## [v0.82.0] - 2025-07-08

### Added
- Part 2: new components with the new design system

### Changed
- Why reinvent the wheel when shadcn/ui already nailed it?
- This release brings templUI’s design system closer to battle-tested patterns that just work – while still keeping it very Go, very templ, and very lightweight.
- It’s not a copy-paste job. It’s about learning from the best and making it ours.
- Design, cleaned up. Hard.
- Shifted to a cleaner, more structured look
- Inspired by shadcn/ui – but tailored for Go devs
- Font upgraded to *Geist* – easier on the eyes
- Theme editor reworked – actually usable now
- Theme switching in vanilla JS – no bloat
- Buttons: now in sm, md, lg (finally)
- Components follow one consistent language
- Refactored a bunch of messy internals
- Better mobile experience
- Dark mode? Now actually good
- Good UI shouldn't fight you. This release lays the foundation for a smoother, faster, more maintainable component system – one that feels familiar if you’ve touched shadcn, but made for Go devs like us.
- More variants, better docs, tighter code
- Feedback loop is open – tell me what sucks

### Removed

- → Better JS integration & Tailwind-friendly styling via `data-open`
- 📘 API Docs: All components now have full API reference in the docs

## [v0.73.2] - 2025-05-29

### Added
- *No new features. Just clean and working as it should.*

### Fixed

### Added
- Replaced external CDN with a locally bundled version of FloatingUI for better reliability and offline support.

### Fixed
- Popovers now use a shared global portal instead of each having its own. This resolves conflicts when multiple popovers or components using popovers were interfering with each other.

## [v0.70.0] - 2025-05-14

### Added
- This is a major release introducing a fundamental shift: templUI is now CLI-first!
- We're thrilled to launch the new `templui` command-line interface! This tool is now the official way to manage templUI components, simplifying installation, versioning, and updates.
- Key Benefits.
- Simplified Management: Add components directly from your terminal.
- Clear Versioning: Fetch components using specific Git refs (tags, branches, commits).
- Direct Integration: Components are installed into your project, giving you full ownership.
- Automatic Path Handling: The CLI adjusts import paths to fit your project structure (defined in `.templui.json`).
- Quick Start.
- *(Ensure Go `bin` is in your PATH)*
- (Creates `.templui.json` and installs utils)
- (Specify versions with `add@<ref> <component>`)
- How Updates Work.
- Re-run `templui add <component-name>[@<ref>]` to update.
- The CLI checks your local file's version. If an update is available, it will prompt to overwrite (unless `--force` is used).
- Important: Manual changes to component files will be lost if overwritten by an update. This is by design, similar to `shadcn/ui`.
- Input OTP: Added `Autofocus` attribute. (Thanks @derkan!)
- Pagination: Customizable "Previous" / "Next" labels. (Thanks @derkan!)
- Popover Showcase: Improved example layouts.
- If you're new to templUI or were using a pre-release CLI version, run.
- Add components as needed using the CLI.
- The `templui` Go module is no longer the primary way to consume components; all component management is now handled through the CLI. We're excited for you to use the new CLI and look forward to your feedback!

### Changed
- Initialize (or re-initialize) in your project.
- This ensures your project is set up with the latest configuration logic.

### Fixed
- Corrected Import Path Logic: The CLI now reliably uses `componentsDir` and `utilsDir` from `.templui.json` for all path rewriting.
- Typos: Various typographical errors corrected. (Thanks @eryk-vieira!)

## [v0.64.0] - 2025-05-08

### Fixed
- HTMX Swap Initialization: Resolved an issue where JavaScript for components (like SelectBox, Popover, etc.) was not reliably re-initialized after certain HTMX swap operations (e.g., `outerHTML`, `beforebegin`). This ensures components are fully interactive after dynamic content updates. Big thanks @derkan for the extensive debugging and collaboration on this!
- Calendar Localization: The Calendar component now correctly displays localized month names according to the provided `localeTag`, using `Intl.DateTimeFormat`. This fixes an issue where only English month names were previously shown.

## [v0.63.0] - 2025-05-07

### Added
- replace setTimeout with requestAnimationFrame in component …

## [v0.62.0] - 2025-05-06

- Implemented visibility toggle functionality for password inputs, improving user experience.
- Refactored Dropdown and SelectBox components to use the Popover system for better positioning consistency.
- Popover component now handles all positioning logic to prevent clipping issues across various contexts.
- Dependencies: Upgraded to templ v0.3.856.
- Code Cleanup: Standardized component styling by removing inline style attributes in favor of Tailwind utility classes.

### Removed
- Toast Positioning: Removed double offset calculation that was causing toast notifications to appear in incorrect positions.

### Fixed
- Calendar/DatePicker: Fixed a critical timezone issue that was causing a 30-day offset in certain timezone configurations.
- Development Workflow: Resolved an issue with the order of `make dev` commands that prevented TailwindCSS from generating CSS files on-the-fly on certain operating systems.
- Chart Tooltips: Fixed inconsistencies where chart tooltips occasionally displayed incorrect labels.

## [v0.61.0] - 2025-04-30

### Added
- Implemented handling for `htmx:oobAfterSwap` events across all relevant components. This ensures components are correctly initialized even when added to the page via Out-of-Band swaps, further improving dynamic update reliability.

### Changed
- Standardized the JavaScript initialization pattern (`initAllComponents`, `handleHtmxSwap`) across all components for better consistency and maintainability.
- Robust Initialization Logic: Refined the component initialization process to better handle edge cases and dependencies (e.g., waiting for external libraries like Chart.js, highlight.js, Floating UI before initialization).
- Code Consistency: Applied the standardized initialization pattern throughout the component JavaScript code.
- While compatibility with HTMX swaps (including OOB) has been significantly enhanced, complex dynamic updates might still reveal edge cases. Please report any unexpected behavior via GitHub issues.

### Removed
- Code Cleanup: Removed redundant checks (e.g., `readyState`) and improved code structure within component scripts.

### Fixed
- Popover: Fixed an issue where popovers might not close correctly after multiple HTMX swaps due to inconsistent state management or listener handling during re-initialization.
- Initialization Errors: Addressed potential TypeErrors during initialization (e.g., in Calendar) caused by incorrect handling of the `DOMContentLoaded` event argument.
- General Stability: Improved the reliability of component initialization, especially in dynamic environments involving HTMX swaps.

## [v0.60.0] - 2025-04-24

### Added
- HTMX Swap Compatibility: All components are now fully compatible with HTMX swaps, ensuring seamless dynamic updates.

### Changed
- Separated the calendar into its own reusable component.
- Simplified and improved the API for both the datepicker and calendar.
- Leveraged native JavaScript Date and locale internals for better browser compatibility.
- Reduced code complexity: Vanilla JS implementations resulted in fewer lines of code compared to Alpine.js.
- Cleaned up and optimized JavaScript across all components.
- While all components are now HTMX swap compatible, there may still be edge cases where swaps don't behave as expected due to the complexity of dynamic updates. If you encounter any issues, please report them ASAP by opening an issue on GitHub. Your feedback is invaluable!

### Removed
- Vanilla JS Migration: Completely removed Alpine.js from the core library and rewrote all components in vanilla JavaScript for better performance, simplicity, and maintainability.
- Removed all Alpine.js dependencies from the codebase.

### Fixed
- Fixed various quirks and issues related to Alpine.js and HTMX swaps.
- Improved component stability and browser compatibility.
